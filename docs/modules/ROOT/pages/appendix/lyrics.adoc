VERSE 1
When you want to shop online then you had better be sure
The experience is safe and also secure

Don't want to let no SQLi or cross-site scripting ruin your day
No, you want to break into a joyous song and say:

CHORUS 1
Juice Shop! Juice Shop!
You can order tasty beverages in any quantity
Juice Shop! Juice Shop!
Just don't test the site with Burp Suite or you won't like what you see

VERSE 2
Now if you're feeling kinda sneaky and you're inclined to explore
You might find inside the Juice Shop...a hidden score board
It will point you towards a vuln'rability or maybe two
And when you're done you'll say, "This site should get a code review!"

CHORUS 2
Juice Shop! Juice Shop!
It has got more holes then a warehouse filled with gallons of Swiss cheese
Juice Shop! Juice Shop!
It's a wet nightmare of broken code that'll bring you to your knees

BRIDGE
I wouldn't let my credit card go anywhere that's near it
If you give Juice Shop your password then you should surely fear it

VERSE 3
So in conclusion I would like to say a final thing or two
I won't be shopping at The Juice Shop with my coupon code for June
The site is nothing more than one big pile of HTTP fail
Whoever made this site should rot for years in Internet jail

CHORUS 1
Juice Shop! Juice Shop!
You can order tasty beverages in any quantity
Juice Shop! Juice Shop!
Just don't test the site with Burp Suite or you won't like what you see
