=== Enforce a redirect to a page you are not supposed to redirect to

This challenge is about _redirecting_ to an entirely disallowed
different location.

* You can find several places where redirects happen in the OWASP Juice
Shop
* The application will only allow you to redirect to _allowlisted_
(previously referred to as _whitelisted_) URLs
* Tampering with the redirect mechanism might give you some valuable
information about how it works under to hood

____
White list validation involves defining exactly what _is_ authorized,
and by definition, everything else is not authorized.footnote:3_11_1[https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html#whitelisting-vs-blacklisting]
____

=== Let us redirect you to one of our crypto currency addresses

Some time ago the Juice Shop project accepted donations via Bitcoin,
Dash and Ether. It never received any, so these were dropped at some
point.

* When removing references to those addresses from the code the
developers have been a bit sloppy.
* More particular, they have been sloppy in a way that even the Angular
Compiler was not able to clean up after them automatically.
* It is of course not sufficient to just visit any of the crypto
currency links _directly_ to solve the challenge.
