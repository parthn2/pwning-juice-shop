=== Overwrite the Legal Information file

____
Uploaded files represent a significant risk to applications. The first
step in many attacks is to get some code to the system to be attacked.
Then the attack only needs to find a way to get the code executed.
Using a file upload helps the attacker accomplish the first step.

The consequences of unrestricted file upload can vary, including
complete system takeover, an overloaded file system or database,
forwarding attacks to back-end systems, client-side attacks, or simple
defacement. It depends on what the application does with the uploaded
file and especially where it is stored.

There are really two classes of problems here. The first is with the
file metadata, like the path and file name. These are generally
provided by the transport, such as HTTP multi-part encoding. This data
may trick the application into overwriting a critical file or storing
the file in a bad location. You must validate the metadata extremely
carefully before using it.

The other class of problem is with the file size or content. The range
of problems here depends entirely on what the file is used for. See
the examples below for some ideas about how files might be misused. To
protect against this type of attack, you should analyse everything
your application does with files and think carefully about what
processing and interpreters are involved.footnote:3_12_3[https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload]
____

* Find all places in the application where file uploads are possible.
* For at least one of these, the Juice Shop is depending on a library
that suffers from an arbitrary file overwrite vulnerability.
* You can find a hint toward the underlying vulnerability in the
https://twitter.com/owasp_juiceshop[@owasp_juiceshop] Twitter
timeline

=== Forge an almost properly RSA-signed JWT token

Like
<<_forge_an_essentially_unsigned_jwt_token,Forge an essentially unsigned JWT token>>
this challenge requires you to make a valid JWT for a user that does not
exist. What makes this challenge even harder is the requirement to have
the JWT look like it was properly signed.

* The three generic hints from
<<_forge_an_essentially_unsigned_jwt_token,Forge an essentially unsigned JWT token>>
also help with this challenge.
* Instead of enforcing no encryption to be applied, try to apply a more
sophisticated exploit against the JWT libraries used in the Juice
Shop.
* Getting your hands on the public RSA key the application employs for
its JWTs is mandatory for this challenge.
* Finding the corresponding private key should actually be impossible,
but that obviously doesn't make this challenge unsolvable.
* Make sure your JWT is URL safe!

=== Inform the shop about a typosquatting imposter that dug itself deep into the frontend

____
Typosquatting, also called URL hijacking, a sting site, or a fake URL,
is a form of cybersquatting, and possibly brandjacking which relies on
mistakes such as typos made by Internet users when inputting a website
address into a web browser. Should a user accidentally enter an
incorrect website address, they may be led to any URL (including an
alternative website owned by a cybersquatter).

The typosquatter's URL will usually be one of four kinds, all similar
to the victim site address (e.g. example.com):

* A common misspelling, or foreign language spelling, of the intended
site: exemple.com
* A misspelling based on typos: examlpe.com
* A differently phrased domain name: examples.com
* A different top-level domain: example.org
* An abuse of the Country Code Top-Level Domain (ccTLD): example.cm by
using .cm, example.co by using .co, or example.om by using .om. A
person leaving out a letter in .com in error could arrive at the
fake URL's website.

Once in the typosquatter's site, the user may also be tricked into
thinking that they are in fact in the real site, through the use of
copied or similar logos, website layouts or content. Spam emails
sometimes make use of typosquatting URLs to trick users into visiting
malicious sites that look like a given bank's site, for instance.footnote:3_12_1[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typosquatting]
____

This challenge is about identifying and reporting (via the
http://localhost:3000/#/contact form) a case of typosquatting hidden in
the Juice Shop. It is supposedly hard to locate.

* This challenge has nothing to do with URLs or domains.
* Other than for
<<_inform_the_shop_about_a_typosquatting_trick_it_has_been_a_victim_of,its legacy companion>>,
combing through the `package.json.bak` does not help for this
challenge.

ℹ️ There is no actual malice or mischief included, as the typosquatter
is completely harmless. Just keep in mind that in reality, a case like
this could come with negative consequences and would sometimes be even
harder to identify.

=== Permanently disable the support chatbot

Juice shop's handy dandy chatbot is cute and all, but can it defend
itself against malicious attackers looking to rob the customers of its
services?

* In order to disable the chatbot for all users, you must first get an
understanding of how it works under the hood
* The chatbot sure offers a lot of functionality. Could it be that
juice-shop relies on a third party, possibly open source library for
this?
* Maybe you can try to gather clues from around juice shop and then go
dumpster dive the internet to get a hold of the bot's source

=== Inform the shop about a typosquatting trick it has been a victim of

This challenge is about identifying and reporting (via the
http://localhost:3000/#/contact form) a case of typosquatting that
successfully sneaked into an older version of the Juice Shop. Luckily,
it is not in use any more in {juiceShopVersion}.

* Just like
<<_inform_the_shop_about_a_typosquatting_imposter_that_dug_itself_deep_into_the_frontend,its frontend companion>>
this challenge also has nothing to do with URLs or domains.
* Investigating the
xref:part2/sensitive-data-exposure.adoc#_access_a_developers_forgotten_backup_file[forgotten developer's backup file]
might bring some insight.
* https://iamakulov.com/notes/npm-malicious-packages/[Malicious packages in npm]
is a worthwhile read on https://iamakulov.com[Ivan Akulov's blog].

=== Gain read access to an arbitrary local file on the web server

____
A *file inclusion vulnerability* is a type of web vulnerability that is most commonly found to affect web applications that rely on a scripting run time. This issue is caused when an application builds a path to executable code using an attacker-controlled variable in a way that allows the attacker to control which file is executed at run time. A file include vulnerability is distinct from a generic directory traversal attack, in that directory traversal is a way of gaining unauthorized file system access, and a file inclusion vulnerability subverts how an application loads code for execution. Successful exploitation of a file inclusion vulnerability will result in remote code execution on the web server that runs the affected web application. An attacker can use remote code execution to create a web shell on the web server, which can be used for website defacement.

*Remote file inclusion (RFI)* occurs when the web application downloads and executes a remote file. These remote files are usually obtained in the form of an HTTP or FTP URI as a user-supplied parameter to the web application.

*Local file inclusion (LFI)* is similar to a remote file inclusion vulnerability except instead of including remote files, only local files i.e. files on the current server can be included for execution. This issue can still lead to remote code execution by including a file that contains attacker-controlled data such as the web server's access logs.footnote:3_12_5[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_inclusion_vulnerability]
____

* You should read up on Local File Read (LFR) vulnerabilities in popular NodeJS template engines
* Look for an easily forgettable endpoint in Juice Shop to test out the LFR attack
* `500 Internal Server Error` is always an interesting status code
* Fuzzing can also help with this challenge

=== Inform the development team about a danger to some of their credentials

____
A software supply chain attack is when an attacker gains access to a
legitimate software vendor and then compromises either the software or
update repository. This is done with the intention of installing a
backdoor, or other malicious code, into the legitimate software update
provided by the vendor. As users update their software, unwittingly
falling victim to the Trojanized update, they also install the
embedded malicious code.footnote:3_12_4[https://www.rsa.com/en-us/blog/2017-02/are-software-supply-chain-attacks-the-new-norm]
____

ℹ️ Please note that having the OWASP Juice Shop installed on your
computer _does not_ put you at any actual risk! This challenge does
_neither_ install a backdoor or Trojan nor does it bring any other
harmful code to your system!

* The shop's end users are not the targets here. The developers of the
shop are!
* This is a research-heavy challenge which does not involve any actual
hacking.
* Solving
xref:part2/sensitive-data-exposure.adoc#_access_a_developers_forgotten_backup_file[Access a developer's forgotten backup file]
before attempting this challenge will save you from a lot of
frustration.

=== Forge an essentially unsigned JWT token

____
JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing
claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are
encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web
Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption
(JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or
integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or
encrypted.footnote:3_12_2[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519]
____

This challenge involves forging a valid JWT for a user that does not
exist in the database but make the application believe it is still
legit.

* You should begin with retrieving a valid JWT from the application's
`Authorization` request header.
* A JWT is only given to users who have logged in. They have a limited
validity, so better do not dawdle.
* Try to convince the site to give you a _valid_ token with the required
payload while downgrading to _no_ encryption at all.
* Make sure your JWT is URL safe!

=== Inform the shop about a vulnerable library it is using

This challenge is quite similar to
xref:part2/cryptographic-issues.adoc#_inform_the_shop_about_an_algorithm_or_library_it_should_definitely_not_use_the_way_it_does[Inform the shop about an algorithm or library it should definitely not use the way it does]
with the difference, that here not the __general use__ of the library is
the issue. The application is just using __a version__ of a library that
contains known vulnerabilities.

* Use the _Contact Us_ form to submit a feedback mentioning the
vulnerable library including its exact version.
* Look for possible dependencies related to security in the
`package.json.bak` you probably harvested earlier during the
xref:part2/sensitive-data-exposure.adoc#_access_a_developers_forgotten_backup_file[Access a developer's forgotten backup file]
challenge.
* Do some research on the internet for known security issues in the most
suspicious application dependencies.
