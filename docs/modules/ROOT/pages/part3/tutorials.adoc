= Hacking Instructor tutorial scripts[[_hacking_instructor_tutorial_scripts]]

include::../attributes.adoc[]

With the xref:part1/challenges.adoc#_hacking_instructor[Hacking Instructor]
the OWASP Juice Shop offers very beginner-friendly tutorial scripts that
guide the user through some of the challenges.

Providing such scripts is a special kind of code contribution. It does
not require sophisticated programming, which is why the following
section will provide an overview of how a Hacking Instructor script is
written.

The Hacking Instructor is part of the
xref:part3/codebase.adoc#_client_tier[Client Tier] but independent of Angular.
Therefore its code lives in a separate folder
`frontend/src/hacking-instructor`:

== Challenge instruction scripts

Any challenge instruction script must provide an implementation of the
`ChallengeInstruction` interface which is defined as

[,javascript]
----
export interface ChallengeInstruction {
  name: string
  hints: ChallengeHint[]
}
----

The `name` property must _exactly_ match the `name` property of the
corresponding challenge in `data/static/challenges.yml`. The actual
tutorial is comprised of a list of hints specified by the
`ChallengeHint` interface:

[,javascript]
----
export interface ChallengeHint {
  /**
   * Text in the hint box
   * Can be formatted using markdown
   */
  text: string
  /**
   * Query Selector String of the Element the hint should be displayed next to.
   */
  fixture: string
  /**
   * Set to true if the hint should be displayed after the target
   * Defaults to false (hint displayed before target)
   */
  fixtureAfter?: boolean
  /**
   * Set to true if the hint should not be able to be skipped by clicking on it.
   * Defaults to false
   */
  unskippable?: boolean
  /**
   * Function declaring the condition under which the tutorial will continue.
   */
  resolved: () => Promise<void>
}
----

=== `text`

The mandatory `text` property is the hint text being displayed to the
user. It must be written in English and in a friendly conversational
tone. If a text gets too long, consider splitting it into two or more
hints that are displayed in sequence instead.

=== `fixture`

With the mandatory `fixture` property the speech bubble with the hint is
bound to a location on the screen. It uses the
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors[CSS selectors]
syntax to find a parent element matching the given `fixture`. The speech
bubble will be dynamically inserted before its parent in the DOM and is
styled as `inline` and `relative` to it. The most commonly used CSS
selectors for `fixture` are:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors[ID selectors]
for the `id` attribute, e.g. `#password` or `#navbarAccount`
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors[Class selectors]
for `class` attributes, e.g. `.noResult`
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors[Type selectors]
for tag names, e.g. `app-navbar`

☝️ Any combination of valid CSS selectors can be used as well, e.g.
`#searchQuery input` to explicitly select the first `<input>` tag within
`<mat-search-bar id="searchQuery">` but _not_ the tag .

=== `fixtureAfter`

By default, thje speech bubbles are displayed _before_ the target
element selected via `fixture`. This can cause it to appear at the top
edge of the screen or over relevant input elements, e.g. in the
navigation bar. In such cases, try setting `fixtureAfter: true` to place
the speech bubble after the target element instead.

=== `unskippable`

By default, you can skip all hints of a script by simply clicking on the
speech bubble. The script will then continue with the next step. For
non-interactive hints that are simply shown for a number of seconds and
then move on, this is mostly fine and intended. For interactive or
otherwise important hints you should set `unskippable: true` to prevent
that behavior.

☝️ For hints which contain some expected input it is recommended to
_always_ set `unskippable: true` to allow the user to select & copy that
part of the text without accidentally triggering the skip feature.

=== `resolved`

Lastly, the `resolved` property must declare a function that returns a
`Promise` which - upon resolution - will let the script continue to the
next hint (or finish the script if there are no more hints left).
Instead of worrying about writing your own functions, have a look at the
available <<_helper_functions,Helper functions>> first. They will make
scripting tutorials a lot easier for you.

== Helper functions

You can import various helper functions from
`frontend/src/hacking-instructor/helpers/helpers.ts` and use them
conveniently as your `resolved` function in any challenge hint:

|===
| Helper function | Usage example

| `waitInMs (timeInMs: number)`
| `resolved: waitInMs(5000)`

| `waitForElementToGetClicked (elementSelector: string)`
| `resolved: waitForElementToGetClicked('#loginButton')`

| `waitForInputToNotBeEmpty (inputSelector: string)`
| `resolved: waitForInputToNotBeEmpty('#password')`

| `waitForInputToHaveValue (inputSelector: string, value: string, options = { ignoreCase: true, replacement: [] })`
| `resolved: waitForInputToHaveValue('#email', "' OR true--")` or with value customization based on configuration property `resolved: waitForInputToHaveValue('#email', "bender@juice-sh.op", { replacement: ['juice-sh.op', 'application.domain'] })`

| `waitForInputToNotHaveValue (inputSelector: string, value: string, options = { ignoreCase: true })`
| `resolved: waitForInputToNotHaveValue('#comment', "WTF?!", { ignoreCase: false })`

| `waitForInputToNotHaveValueAndNotBeEmpty (inputSelector: string, value: string, options = { ignoreCase: true })`
| `resolved: waitForInputToNotHaveValueAndNotBeEmpty('#comment', "WTF?!", { ignoreCase: false })`

| `waitForElementsInnerHtmlToBe (elementSelector: string, value: String)`
| `resolved: waitForInputToHaveValue('#searchQuery input', 'owasp')`

| `waitForAngularRouteToBeVisited (route: String)`
| `resolved: waitForAngularRouteToBeVisited('login')`

| `waitForLogIn ()`
| `resolved: waitForLogIn()`

| `waitForLogOut ()`
| `resolved: waitForLogOut()`

| `waitForDevTools ()`
| `resolved: waitForDevTools()`
|===

ℹ️ The helper functions are supposed to be self-explanatory enough on
their own. Please check out the <<_reference_example,Reference example>>
for more information on when and how to use each one.

== Registering a new script

To register a new script, it only needs to be imported and included in
the `challengeInstructions: ChallengeInstruction[]` within
`frontend/src/hacking-instructor/index.ts`:

[,javascript]
----
import { LoginAdminInstruction } from './challenges/loginAdmin'
import { DomXssInstruction } from './challenges/localXss'
import { ScoreBoardInstruction } from './challenges/scoreBoard'

const challengeInstructions: ChallengeInstruction[] = [
  ScoreBoardInstruction,
  LoginAdminInstruction,
  DomXssInstruction
]
----

As long as the ``name``s defined in the script and `challenges.yml` match,
the tutorial will be automatically wired into the _Score Board_.

== Reference example

The following code snippet shows the entire tutorial script for the
xref:part2/injection.adoc#_log_in_with_the_administrators_user_account[Login Admin]
challenge. As it uses most available helpers, two custom
`resolved`-functions as well as Markdown to style some hint texts, it is
the perfect reference for your own scripts:

[,javascript]
----
import {
  waitForInputToHaveValue,
  waitForInputToNotBeEmpty,
  waitForElementToGetClicked,
  waitInMs,
  waitForAngularRouteToBeVisited, waitForLogOut
} from '../helpers/helpers'
import { ChallengeInstruction } from '../'

export const LoginAdminInstruction: ChallengeInstruction = {
  name: 'Login Admin',
  hints: [
    {
      text:
        "To start this challenge, you'll have to log out first.",
      fixture: '#navbarAccount',
      unskippable: true,
      resolved: waitForLogOut()
    },
    {
      text:
        "Let's try if we find a way to log in with the administrator's user account. To begin, go to the _Login_ page via the _Account_ menu.",
      fixture: 'app-navbar',
      fixtureAfter: true,
      unskippable: true,
      resolved: waitForAngularRouteToBeVisited('login')
    },
    {
      text: 'To find a way around the normal login process we will try to use a **SQL Injection** (SQLi) attack.',

      resolved: waitInMs(8000)
    },
    {
      text: "A good starting point for simple SQL Injections is to insert quotation marks (like `\"` or `'`). These mess with the syntax of an insecurely concatenated query and might give you feedback if an endpoint is vulnerable or not.",

    {
      text: 'Mhh... The query is still invalid? Can you see why from the new error in the console?',
      fixture: '#rememberMe',
      resolved: waitInMs(8000)
    },
    {
      text: "We need to make sure that the rest of the query after our injection doesn't get executed. Any Ideas?",
      fixture: '#rememberMe',
      resolved: waitInMs(8000)
    },
