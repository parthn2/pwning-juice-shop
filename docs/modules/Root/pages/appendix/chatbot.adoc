= Chatbot training data[[_chatbot_training_data]]
include::../attributes.adoc[]

Under the hood of the _Support Chat_ an NLP-powered chatbot is used to
anwer customer questions. Upon server start it is initialized with a
training data set, so it can give some meaningful answers and replies.

The general structure of the file is straightforward:

[,json]
----
{
  "lang": "en",
  "data": [
    {
      "intent": "unique identifier for a conversation intent",
      "utterances": [
        "something a user might ask",
        "something else a user might ask",
        "..."
      ],
      "answers": [
        {
          "action": "response",
          "body": "an answer the bot will give"
        },
        {
          "action": "response",
          "body": "another anwer the bot will give"
        },
        {
          "action": "response",
          "body": "..."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "...": "..."
    }
  ]
}
----

== Defining conversational ``intent``s

A simple conversational intent, e.g. for exchanging a friendly greeting,
could be specified like this:

[,json]
----
{
  "intent": "greetings.hello",
  "utterances": [
    "hello",
    "hi",
    "howdy",
    "hey",
    "good morning",
    "good afternoon"
  ],
  "answers": [
    {
      "action": "response",
      "body": "Hello there!"
    },
    {
      "action": "response",
      "body": "Hi there!"
    },
    {
      "action": "response",
      "body": "\uD83D\uDC4B"
    }
  ]
}
----

== Special `function` actions

Apart from normal text conversations, the chatbot also supports three
distinct `function` actions. These do not reply with a text from the
data set, but trigger a code function and respond with its return value
to the user.

. `productPrice` - Uses fuzzy matching to find product names in the
query of the user and replies with their price. The easiest to do is
just copy it from the `botDefaultTrainingData.json` file.
. `couponCode` - This function will respond with a 10% coupon code for
the current month. It should be used alongside at least 10 other
regular ``response``s, so that the user will not immediately get the
coupon when asking for it. This makes the challenge
xref:part2/miscellaneous.adoc#_receive_a_coupon_code_from_the_support_chatbot[Receive a coupon code from the support chatbot]
more interesting. See the
<<_training_data_example,Training data example>> on how to set this up
optimally.
. `testFunction` - This should be the singular entry in `answers` to a
singular entry in `utterances` and is only used for testing purposes.

[,json]
----
{
  "intent": "queries.productPrice <or> queries.couponCode <or> queries.functionTest",
  "utterances": [
    "..."
  ],
  "answers": [
    {
      "action": "function",
      "handler": "productPrice <or> couponCode <or> testFunction"
    }
  ]
}
----

If you write your own training data file from scratch, you need exactly
one `intent` for each of these three ``handler``s. If you do not have
these defined, Juice Shop will tell you during the
xref:appendix/troubleshooting.adoc#_start_up_validations[Start-up validations]. To
avoid any such issues, it is recommended to just start with a copy of
the `botDefaultTrainingData.json` file when definiing your own chatbot
conversations.
